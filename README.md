Imageboard Mei
==============

Mei is a Futaba-styled imageboard, allowing people to discuss and upload pictures. My aim is to improve the user interface to my liking, instead of mimicking the traditional Futaba's look & feel.

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/lulalala/mei/wiki) to see more information! I try to minimize number of commits so documentations are all over there!**

### Highlights
